‚úÖ Let‚Äôs analyze your code:

ts
Copy
Edit
const token = streamClient.generateUserToken({ user_id: user.id });
Yes ‚Äî this line is generating a Stream user token using the Stream server SDK. Under the hood, generateUserToken produces a JWT with a payload including an iat (issued at) timestamp.

Your error:

‚Äútoken used before issue at (iat)‚Äù

‚Ä¶means that the server verifying this token thinks the iat is in the future, which usually happens due to clock drift between:

your server (where generateUserToken runs)

Stream‚Äôs infrastructure (which verifies the token)

Why this happens
When your server clock is ahead of Stream‚Äôs servers by even a few seconds, the generated iat will appear ‚Äúin the future‚Äù to Stream, causing it to reject the token.

Since JWT time validation is quite strict, a few seconds of mismatch can break it.

‚úÖ How to fix
1Ô∏è‚É£ Sync your server clock.
Since you are on Next.js (likely Vercel), the serverless functions should already use an NTP-synced clock, but if running locally or self-hosted, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
or verify with:

bash
Copy
Edit
date
to check the correct UTC time.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a leeway buffer (recommended)

If you suspect a tiny offset in clocks, Stream‚Äôs SDK allows you to adjust the issued-at manually. For example, you could do:

ts
Copy
Edit
const token = streamClient.generateUserToken(
  { user_id: user.id },
  Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 10 // 10 seconds in the past
);
üëâ That sets the token‚Äôs iat 10 seconds earlier, giving a small tolerance. Stream usually accepts that perfectly.

‚úÖ So the practical fix is to change:

ts
Copy
Edit
const token = streamClient.generateUserToken({ user_id: user.id });
to

ts
Copy
Edit
const token = streamClient.generateUserToken(
  { user_id: user.id },
  Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 10 // backdate iat by 10 seconds
);
which is the simplest robust way to eliminate minor clock drift issues.

If the problem still occurs after that, then it is almost certainly a server clock misconfiguration, and you should double-check that your deployment host uses a reliable NTP service.
